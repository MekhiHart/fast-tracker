# What is Fast Tracker
Fast Tracker is a project submitted for a 24 hour Google Sponsored hackathon that won Best Google Cloud Hack while competing as a solo competitor. The main function of this web application is to streamline the process of taking attendance for events through the use of QR Codes. This tool is significant for organizations that require attendees to check-in to confirm their attendance in an efficient matter especially in a high populated events. Example use case for this is for ticketed events where only authorized attendees are allowed to enter the venue, while also calculating the number of authorized attendees that decided to show up to track popularity of the event. Fast Tracker can be used in this situation to give attendees a QR code and quickly scan their QR code using Fast Tracker to instantly record their attendance in the database, while also refusing unauthorized attendees.

## Features:
- Sign In user in database
- Register user's attendance in database
- Create QR Code of Attendee
- Scans QR code of Attendee
- Handle transaction of Event points (meant to incentivize attendees to attend more events in exchange for merchendize)

## Tech Stack:
- Front-End: React and TypeScript
- Back-End: Cloud Firestore
- External Libraries: QR Generator and QR scanner

## Setting up
- Clone the repo in a new local repo
  - git init
  - git remote add origin <clone url link>
  - git fetch
  - git pull origin main

- Installing and Running
    - npm i
    - npm run dev
    - run application from local host and you're good to go!
    - See YouTube video from my portfolio to learn more, registering new users in the database is not a feature because it assumes the attendee is already propagated to the database

## Project Proposal

<aside>
üìà Stakeholders

</aside>

The BeachHacks Organization; specifically the logistics/operations team who want to analyze the data later, and for Committee Directors who want to have 100% confidence on their data to improve upon the next Hackathon

<aside>
üîë Problems Being Solved

</aside>

- Registering hackathon attendees is through spreadsheet
- Registering event and workshop attendees is through spreadsheet
- Current Alerts-App program only tracks interest for workshops and event
    - Not responsible for registering attendees

<aside>
‚ùì Why is the use of spreadsheet problematic?

</aside>

- Problematic for the data during its generation phase of the data lifecycle when using spreadsheet due potential human errors
- Attendance takers are working long hours that could potentially make mistakes and harm the integrity of data inputted

<aside>
‚öô Problems for data generation using spreadsheet

</aside>

1. Key Point:  Data generation is the responsibility for Attendees!; want to shift responsibility to BeachHacks volunteers using software
2. Attendees are:
    1. Tired from lack of sleep, and exhausted from coding
    2. Focus is towards the event they want to join, having them do a google form is repetitive annoying, and **TIME CONSUMING**
    

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Main Concerns

</aside>

1. Data Integrity
    1. Attendees can input wrong data, making data inputted invalid
2. Ease of Accessibility for Attendees and BeachHacks volunteers
    1. Want to prioritize the experience for attendees. Removing the responsibility of data generation of them will allow attendees to focus on the events they want to attend
    2. BeachHacks volunteers are required to remain at the event to help attendees who are having problems
    3. Edge case of attendees not having devices that have the CPU to take google form quiz
    

<aside>
üî• Problems solved by software

</aside>

- Avoid Data Integrity problems by shifting data generation responsibilities to software. Data generated during the event be used with a 100% confidence by:
    - Analysts during the analysis state of the data lifecycle
    - Committee Directors and project managers to plan next BeachHacks in 2024 during the interpretation state of the data lifecycle
- Improve BeachHacks experience for attendees with the lack of repetitive activities
- Make BeachHacks volunteers have a better experience through less repetitive jobs

üí° Software Use Cases

</aside>


| Use Case 1  | Login to Account  |
| --- | --- |
| Actors | BeachHacks Attendee |
| Pre-Condition | Attendee must have been registered officially for BeachHacks by logistics/operations |
| Flow of Control | - User clicks on register button
‚Äî> System displays input fields 

- Fill out unique key given by BH 
- Click submit |
| Post-Conditions | System displays attendee profile |
| Error-Condition | Invalid Key inputted
Attendee is already logged in |
| Non-Functional Requirements | User interface must be user-friendly |



| Use Case 2 | Register attendee for event |
| --- | --- |
| Actors | BeachHacks Volunteer |
| Pre-Condition | Attendee has not registered for the event intended on attending |
| Flow of Control | - BH Volunteer scans QR code of attendee |
| Post-Conditions | System will update attendee‚Äôs status of being attended the event in the Database |
| Error-Condition | - QR code does not scan, volunteer registers attendee manually |
| Non-Functional Requirements | - Registration should be processed within 1-2 seconds   |

<aside>
üõ† Expanding the software

</aside>

- Adding event points to user profile to create incentives for attendees to attend planned BeachHacks events
    - Logistics/Operations will be involved to sell merch based on the the user‚Äôs event points
